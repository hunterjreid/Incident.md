  ## 12. Plan Maintenance and Testing:
  Specify the frequency for reviewing and updating the incident response plan to reflect changes in technology, threats, and organizational structure. Define a schedule for conducting tabletop exercises and simulations to test the effectiveness of the plan and IRT members' readiness.

  ## 13. Legal and Compliance Considerations:
  Address legal requirements and compliance obligations, such as data breach notification laws and industry regulations. Outline the role of legal counsel in incident response, including preserving evidence and handling potential legal actions.

  ## 14. Resources and Tools:
  Provide a list of recommended resources, such as incident response playbooks, reference materials, and online courses for continuous learning. Identify tools that can aid in incident detection, response, and recovery, such as cybersecurity software and communication platforms.
